# Machine Learning Problems with Python

This project contains the ML solution for solving the Titanic Survival problem found on Kaggle.

This solution uses XGBoost and Random Forest Algorithm to produce around 80% accuracy on Kaggles test set. I would like to see how other approaches can be used to improve my prediction accuracy.
